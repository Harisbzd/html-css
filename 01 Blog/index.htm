                    I started writing on Medium in 2016 when blogging was my hobby. A few months later, I realized the monetary potential of this blogging platform, and it’s proven to be a great start for my writing career.

                <section>
                    Medium is a social publishing platform that is open to all users and home to a diverse array of stories, ideas, and perspectives. Anyone can write for the platform, so it's great for beginners.

                    As Medium founder (and Blogger creator/Twitter co-founder) <a href="">Ev Williams</a> wrote when he launched the platform in 2012: “Medium is not about who you are or whom you know, but about what you have to say.”
                </p>
            </section>
            <h2>How Does Medium Work?</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    The first thing you'll notice on the Medium website is its site design.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    As former HubSpot Senior Content Strategist <a href="#">Erik Devaney</a> says, “It's minimalistic, featuring lots of white space and limited formatting options. Want to change the header typeface to Comic Sans? You can't. Medium won't allow for such atrocities of design.”
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This decision makes great writing the focus. But that's just one of many nuances of Medium.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Medium is for two types of people — writers and readers — who are focused on online content publishing. When I started my career in content writing and strategy, I wasn‘t sure what that meant.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I discovered Medium because I was trying to figure out where to build my writing portfolio. I’d heard Medium was a good choice, but the first time I signed up, I wasn't sure how to use it.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    If you‘re just getting started on the platform, there’s a fair amount to learn before you hit publish. Let's get into it.
                </p>
            </section>
            <h2>Quality Leads to Discovery</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Many writers go years without sharing their writing publicly. But once you decide to become a writer, whether you're finishing a first novel or writing content for brands, you need to find a way to share your skills.
                    <br/>
                    Medium is great for writers who invest time and energy in their work. It rewards in-depth, well-researched, and useful articles, not just popularity or brand awareness.
                </p>
            </section>
            <h2>Platform-Enabled Reader Engagement</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Comments and likes are popular in online media. But when you‘re new to writing, it’s helpful to know exactly what people are responding to and why.
                    <br/>
                    To meet this need, Medium gives readers a chance to highlight and comment directly within the text of each article. This process is like the way professional editors engage with writers.
                </p>
            </section>
            <h2>Curation and Publications</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Medium has curators who review articles for quality. If a curator chooses your article for wider distribution, it gives you a chance to introduce your content to more readers.
                    <br/>
                    This might include highlighting your article on the platform, showing your post to readers they think will want to read it, or adding it to subscriber emails.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <img src="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/hubfs/how-to-use-Medium-2-20240723-3464477.webp" alt="">
                <p>Most curators are publication editors. Some of the most <a href="">popular publications on Medium in 2023 include</a>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Startup.</li>
                    <li>Towards Data Science.</li>
                    <li>Personal Growth.</li>
                    <li>UX Collective.</li>
                    <li>The Writing Cooperative.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Medium’s curation and publication models aren’t just great for writers. They also give avid readers and fans a chance to support their favorite writers.
                </p>
            </section>
            <h2>Paid Opportunities</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Medium also gives writers the chance to earn money with their stories. As a member of the Partner Program, you can put stories behind a paywall to earn income.
                    <br/>
                    In this program, you can increase earnings with repeat readers, engagement signals, and more.
                </p>
            </section>
            <h2>Writing for Medium</h2>
            <section>
                Anyone who has a Medium account can write for Medium — there's no other vetting process involved.
                <br/>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        To get started, simply <a href="">sign up for a free Medium account</a> (or upgrade to a $5/month membership for unlimited access), and you're ready to start writing from there.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        It’s important to know that articles must adhere to Medium‘s content guidelines and rules. For instance, as a writer I can’t promote controversial or extreme content on my Medium account. I can‘t do third-party advertising. And there’s a separate set of policies if I want to write about <a href="">cryptocurrencies</a>.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Affiliate marketing links are allowed, but writers must tell their audience that they're including these links. For the full list of rules for content, take a look at this post on <a href="">Medium Rules</a>.
